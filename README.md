# LLM-Project-Fine-tuning-RoBERTa-for-IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I fine-tuned an LLM â€” RoBERTa-base ðŸ¤– using the IMDB Movie Reviews dataset (from Kaggle) containing 5,000 reviews labeled as Positive or Negative. The workflow involved preprocessing text, tokenizing with Hugging Face, and fine-tuning RoBERTa with a classification head for sentiment analysis.
